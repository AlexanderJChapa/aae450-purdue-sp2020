## Instructions
Please upload your codes into a subfolder in your discipline, labelled with your name. 

An example of the path for my code would be:

> aae450-purdue-sp2020/**Controls/beverley_yeo/calcforces.m**
    
The parts in bold would be what you need to change.
If there is no folder for your discipline yet, feel free to make one.
Discipline folders are **CASE-SENSITIVE**, please remember to capitalize the folder name! 
Whether you want to capitalize your name or not is up to you, but please replace spaces with an *underscore* (e.g. beverley yeo --> beverley_yeo)
